=head1 BUILDING

Build this module as you would any perl module, by doing something
akin to the following:

 gzip -dc distname-XX.YY.tar.gz | tar -xof -
 cd distname-XX.YY/
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test                                     # optional
 make install

See L<perlmodinstall>(1) for details.
